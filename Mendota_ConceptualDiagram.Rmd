The purpose of this program is to draw the conceptual diagram of the pools and 
fluxes of P for the system.

Step 1. Load the data and packages needed:

```{r}
library(DiagrammeR) #needed for conceptual model
```

Below is the conceptual model for a summer, stratified lake, assuming the 
metalimnion is negligible, and the flux of P in and out. 

``` {r}
grViz("
digraph SEM {

graph [layout = dot,
       overlap = false, fontsize = 20]

node [shape = rectangle]

a [label = 'External Load', shape = oval]
b [label = 'External Export', shape = oval]
c [label = 'Epilimnion']
d [label = 'Hypolimnion']
e [label = 'Sediments']
f [label = 'Permanent Burial', shape = oval]
a->c
c->b
c->d [label = 'Settling']
d->c [label = '    Entrainment']
d->e [label = 'Settling']
e->d [label = '   Internal Load']
e->f 
}
")
```
